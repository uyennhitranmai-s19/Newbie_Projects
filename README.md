# 🌱 Newbie Projects

Welcome to my small corner of experiments!  
This repository contains some of my first mini web projects — simple but meaningful steps in my learning journey as an IT student.

## 📂 Projects Included

1. **Calendar Tool**  
   → A basic HTML page that displays a calendar interface.  
   (My goal: understand HTML table layout and date formatting.)

2. **Drawing Tool**  
   → A small drawing page using the `<canvas>` element.  
   (My goal: practice JavaScript event handling and canvas API.)

3. **To-do List**  
   → A simple to-do list that lets users add and remove tasks.  
   (My goal: learn how to manipulate DOM elements dynamically.)

## 💡 Purpose
These projects are beginner-level exercises I built while learning HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.  
They may look simple, but each project helped me grasp a new web development concept.
