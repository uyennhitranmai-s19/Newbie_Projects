# Newbie Projects

Hi there!  
This is a small collection of my very first web projects. Nothing fancy, just me trying to figure out how HTML works (and sometimes breaking it along the way) :)

## What’s inside

**Calendar Tool**  
A basic calendar page. I built this one just to understand how to layout dates and play around with HTML tables.

**Drawing Tool**  
A small web page where you can draw with your mouse. I made it while learning about the `<canvas>` element and JavaScript events.

**To-do List**  
A simple to-do list where you can add and remove tasks. This was my first try at DOM manipulation and making a web page actually “do something”.

## Why I made these

I started these projects when I was learning the basics of front-end development. They might look simple, but each one taught me something new how to structure HTML, how to use events, and how to debug when nothing works as expected.

## What’s next

I plan to improve them over time, maybe add some CSS and JavaScript to make them more interactive.  
For now, they’re just small milestones that remind me where I started.

## About me

I’m Nhi, an IT student who loves learning by building small things.  
I don’t aim for perfection right now, just progress.  
Every mini project here is a step forward.
